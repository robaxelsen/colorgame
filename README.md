# A JavaScript Color Game

A game written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, to help you get better at rgb() color
codes.

## How To Play

Guess what color the rgb() code is by clicking on the color squares.

You can click "New Colors" to reset the colors, and "Try Again?" once you've
successfully guessed the right color.

Choose "EASY" or "HARD" difficulty, which switched between 3 or 6 color circles
to guess from.
